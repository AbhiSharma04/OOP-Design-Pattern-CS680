The program allows you to determine the cost of various electrical components such as
resistors, coils, and thyristors.
The Strategy pattern is used to encapsulate each kind of part's cost calculation algorithms.
We can input the number of items and it will return the total price.
PriceCalculate is the interface class which is implemented by Coill,Thyristor and Resistor.
